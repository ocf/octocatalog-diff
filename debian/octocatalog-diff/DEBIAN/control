Description: compile and compare Puppet catalogs from 2 branches, versions, etc
 octocatalog-diff is a tool to detect and display differences in Puppet
 catalogs compiled from different environments. The catalogs may be
 obtained through any of the following means:
  - Compilation using a local puppet instance
  - Puppet master 3.x/4.x HTTP API
  - PuppetDB HTTP API
  - Precompiled JSON catalogs
 .
 octocatalog-diff filters out attributes or resources with no effect
 (e.g. tags) and displays only state differences between the two
 catalogs. It does not require a working Puppet master (or puppetserver),
 making it suitable for development use and use in Continuous Integration
 environments.
